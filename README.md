# Welcome to PSYMed!
This is the official code repository of our undergraduate thesis, **PSYMed: Detecting Panic Attack Precursors Using a Convolutional Neural Network-based Facial Expression Recognition Model**

--

## Project overview:
PSYmed is a Facial Expression Recognition Convolutional Neural Network (FER-CNN) model that is capable of recognizing panic attack precursors through facial expressions. 

**Datasets used:** `FER2013`, `MMAFEDB`, and a modified, light version of `FER-AffectNet`
**Training models:** `VGG-16`, `HaarCascade (for facial recognition)`
